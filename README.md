## Login

To begin using FinGrow and authorize with Metamask as a blockchain wallet, follow these steps:

1. Install the Metamask extension on Google Chrome using [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en-GB).

2. Click "Add to Chrome" and follow the prompts to create a new wallet or import an existing one. Accept the terms and conditions and choose a new password for your wallet.

3. Follow the recommended flow to generate a secret word phrase, which will be used as a recovery password. Click "Reveal Secret Word Phrase" to see a 12-word phrase, copy it and keep it safe for future use. Click "Next" and complete the phrase you generated in the previous step.

4. Pin the Metamask extension from the list of extensions, so that it will always be visible on Chrome tabs.

5. To connect to the FinGrow app, go to [Local Environment](http://localhost:3000/pages/login) or [Production Environment](https://fin-grow.vercel.app/pages/login) and click "Connect Wallet".
